This is a simple project I wrote for some guys in HAM community. It never reached completion on their site, nonetheless I feel It's kind of nice, and may be repurposed some day.

It requires no backend to work, just a device with http server, with CORS policy configured properly.

Please note, it's written in PURE JAVASCRIPT, there's no node_modules or anything like that, just like Stallman intended.

Also, I wrote it 4 years ago, before I had any commercial experience with programming, so If you're here to hire me, don't take any conclusions from the quality of code or anything.
